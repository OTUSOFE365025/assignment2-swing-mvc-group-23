Example of an MVC design based on Swing. Answer questions 1 & 2 in this README file.

Q1).  
Java Swing is a subset of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) which gives a complete collection of GUI components to develop desktop applications with Java. It is based on the older Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), and is said to be more flexible and powerful. The components of swing are said to be lightweight, that is, they are completely written in the Java language and do not have a strong dependency on the native operating systems to render. This renders Swing applications very cross platform portable. Swing has a big selection of GUI components in the form of buttons, text fields, tables, labels, panels, and frames. These elements provide a pluggable appearance system, enabling developers to modify the appearance of the application to suit different operating systems or home-made themes. One of the main architectural peculiarities of Swing is the fact that it supports the pattern of Model-View-Controller (MVC). Swing components are normally used to separate the data (Model), the user interface (View), and the interaction logic (Controller) and this enhances code maintainability and scalability. Swing has commonly been applied in education, business software, and development utility and is still a current GUI toolkit in teaching event-driven and component-based Java programming.

Q2)
The sample project in the GitHub repository is based on a design pattern known as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) that is a typical method of designing graphical user interfaces. In this structure, the Model will be taking care of the data and the business operations; in this scenario, the CashRegister class will deal with product information, scanning items and subtotal computations. The View will be represented by the Display class which displays the user interface, the scrollable list of scanned items and the running subtotal. The Controller is the coordinator: it's the one that hears button presses (e.g. Scan button), requests the model to update the data, and requests the view to update its display.

In comparison to textbook MVC pattern which was taught in lectures, Swing variant is more tightly coupled. As an example, the View reveals elements (such as the Scan button) which are directly manipulated by the Controller. The Controller can also update the View directly rather than by means of a messaging system. The small desktop applications are made easier by this kind of coupling and do not necessarily need to be totally decoupled. Dividing the concerns is not enforced in this way, but this is a pragmatic way of adapting it when using Swing-based GUIs, and is acceptable enough to be used in learning. It is practical enough and transparent enough in small to medium projects such as this one.
